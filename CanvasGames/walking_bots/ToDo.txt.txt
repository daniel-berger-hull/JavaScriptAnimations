Create a SpriteVideoObject
--------------------------
	Extend the VideoObject with a SpriteVideoObject: The frames should be handled in the SpriteVideoObject,
	and not in the VideoObject. Revert the VideoObject to what it was, meaning that it should deal only
	with position, speed and a single image.
	

Add the other directions
------------------------
       Currently, the direction covered in the image are only going up/down/right.
       Add the left image in the jpg image, then adapt the future SpriteVideoObject
       to cover the other directions for the bots.
       
Add collisions
--------------
	Regarless if other directions are added or not, the bots collide between themselves,
	but nothing happen so far. Add a collision detection, and the bots should change directions

Add Stearing
------------
	The bots are going in straight line, so maybe the stearing functions, as discussed in the
	book [Programming Game AI by Example - Mat Buckland]. There are many items to cover here,
	like following path, flock behavior, pursut etc...
